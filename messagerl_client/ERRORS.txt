applications for both client and server can be installed and
started without any (apparent) problem

when I try to test the application, the only thing i can do at first
is registering an account (every other action being forbidden without
an account), I don't know why but it makes a call to terminate which
kills the client gen_server and therefore forbid us to register anything
and so to test the rest of the application

the only way to fix it will be to know why this call is made, but i
don't know how to get this information
